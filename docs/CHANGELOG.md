  * 3.0.0
  * Info about new version
  * Moving to a common js require style instead of the module import syntax for usage reasons. I just want the thing here to be usable on plain node. As much "new javascript" is supported I will use. I just want to use the project in anothe rproject and hit that roadblock :) So now this is usable out of a browser.
